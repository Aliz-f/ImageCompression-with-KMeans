# ImageCompression-with-KMeans
In an RGB image, each pixel is represented by three 8-bit integers (ranging from 0 to 255) that specify the red, green, and blue intensity values. A typical image contains many different colors, which can be compressed by finding a smaller set of representative colors using K-means clustering.
